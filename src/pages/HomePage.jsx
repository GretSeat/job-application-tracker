          Similar to Git Hubs Little Green Squares, where you will get a box
          ticked off when you complete a full set of your daily todo list.

        <h2>Calendar</h2>
        <p>Calendar will be to show at a glance what you have coming up.</p>
        <h2>How Many Applications have you put in?</h2>
        <p>
          This will track how many applications you are away from your daily
          goal.
